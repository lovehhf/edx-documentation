*****************************
Enroll for Academic Credit
*****************************

To receive academic credit for a course, you must enroll in the verified track
for the course. You become eligible to purchase academic credit after you earn
a verified certificate.

When you take a course for academic credit, you may have to verify your
identity several times during the course, take proctored exams, or both.

========================================
Identity Verification for Credit Courses
========================================

When you take a course for academic credit, you must verify your identity both
at the beginning of the course and at certain times during the course. For
example, you may be required to verify your identity before you take each
exam.

.. note:: To be eligible for academic credit, you must verify your identity 
 every time that you receive a request to verify your identity. If you choose
 not to verify your identity at any time, you are no longer eligible for
 credit. You can still receive a verified certificate in the course.

When you must verify your identity, you see the following message in the
courseware.

.. code:: 

	Identity verification required

	To receive credit for this course, you must verify your identity every
	time you receive a verification message. If you do not want to verify your
	identity, you can opt out of verification. However, you will no longer be
	eligible for credit in the course.

Select **Verify Now** to begin the ID verification process. The steps for
verifying your identity during the course are the same as the steps at the
beginning of the course. For more information, see :ref:`SFD Verify Your
Identity`.

Keep Track of Your Progress

When you are enrolled in a course for academic credit, your **Progress** page
includes a section that lists all of the requirements that you have to
complete to be eligible for credit. This section indicates your overall credit
eligibility status and the status of each individual requirement.

Purchase Academic Credit
*****************************

After you receive your verified certificate for the course, the option to
purchase academic credit for the course appears on your dashboard below the
option to download your certificate. When you purchase credit, you submit a
payment to edX, and then complete any additional steps that the specific
organization that grants the credit requires.


**Cred-el email as well? See https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b_YTQvkhe-kp6jj2am-FD7Wgxuie2gs6qTfmHNvrnIM/edit**

.. Does info about the deadline for purchasing course credit appear on the
.. dashboard too, or not until the Purchase Credit For page?

.. note:: More than one organization might offer credit for the same course. 
 If this is the case, you select the organization that you want when you
 purchase credit for the course.

To purchase academic credit, follow these steps.

#. On your dashboard, select **Purchase Credit** next to the course that you want.
#. On the **Purchase credit for** page, select the organization that you want
   to purchase credit from, and then select **Check Out** or **Check Out with
   PayPal**.
#. Follow the onscreen instructions to complete the payment process. A
   confirmation page opens and you receive an email message when the payment
   process is complete.
#. On the payment confirmation page, note whether the organization requires
   you to complete additional steps to receive credit. If the organization has
   additional requirements, select **Complete Credit** to go to that
   organization's website.

After the organization has evaluated your information, a message on your
dashboard indicates whether the organization has granted the academic credit
for the course and provides a link to the organization. You also receive an
email that indicates whether you have received academic credit for the course.
